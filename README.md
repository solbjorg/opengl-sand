# Journey-like sand in OpenGL

This is my final project for TDT4230, accounting for 20% of my grade. In it, I
endeavour to create sand similar to the game Journey in OpenGL, inspired by
[this GDC talk](https://youtu.be/wt2yYnBRD3U).

# How to build

On Linux:

```
cd build
cmake ..
make
./glowbox
```
