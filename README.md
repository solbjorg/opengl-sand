# Journey-like sand in OpenGL

This is my final project for TDT4230, accounting for 20% of my grade. In it, I
endeavour to create sand similar to the game Journey in OpenGL, inspired by
[this GDC talk](https://youtu.be/wt2yYnBRD3U).

# Credit
I was entirely focused on the graphical effect. Models and textures were lifted
from Atwood Deng's similar Unity project, found [here](https://github.com/AtwoodDeng/JourneySand).

Current sand texture from [here](https://www.deviantart.com/marlborolt/art/Sand-Ripples-439027940).
